# Hate-Speech-Classification

The freedom of speech is a well guarded right across many countries in the world, but certain boundaries are always set. The rise of plenty of social media apps and online communities has given people a medium to express their opinions and interact with each other on any number of topics. Some discussions are polite and gentle while others turn ugly. People turn provocative against each other over petty disapprovals and start hurling abuses and hateful comments. Such type of negativity has a bad impact on online commuity and may lead to bad consequences. 

Such community based apps often issue a code and conduct manual going against which results in a permanent account ban. They also give other users the option to report a complaint against a toxic user. The companies go through the comments and posts of that user to verify people's complaint. Since such big companies have to deal with many complaints in a given day, there is no possible way that they can manually verify each and every account. Thus the companies leverage the use of **sentiment analysis**. 

Sentiment analysis is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique. It is a supervised learning algorithm that is trained on a text and its label.
